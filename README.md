# KnowledgeFoundationHackathon2024-AI-Solution-
This is the Github Repo made for The Knowledge Foundation Hackathon, I have gone the AI route and here lies my solution/upgrade

I really struggled with this Hackathon so, i basically did next to next nothing to make any changes, what i did do though was try to figure out how everything works, 
which was such a struggle, the code wasnt the problem it was really clean and precise, i just didnt know how to navigate the hackathon itself. 

with that being said here are the things i wouldve changed, and improved on 
1) the davinci app doesnt have one clear ai model, it gives you a lot of options to choose from, but understanding that a lot of people in disadvantaged areas may not know about differant ai models, i wouldve given one ai model that would accomodate all search engines.
2) having to choose and download an ai model also is a disadvatage because a lot of people may not have access to wifi, so again i would just put in one ai model that just gives information about anti-corruption
3) the ai was slow, i dont know how i couldve fixed that to make it faster
4) i wouldve added a login section because i didnt see one, so that the users information is saved, so that the ai can recognise the users patterns and build on the users patterns, regarding any anti corruption questions.


this is my first time doing this hackathon and working on internet computers and ai as well the motoko language, overrall i wish i couldve done more but unfortunately i struggled but with more practice on motoko and the internet computer, and how it works ill definitely do better in upcoming hackathons. 

thank you
